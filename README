My changes are released under the public domain.

This package modifies the package in sdl1/ to include support for tilesets. Characters that have the A_INVIS(now mapped to A_TILESET) attribute set will be interpreted differently. To be specific, the two least significant bytes will be interpreted as tileset identifier, resulting in up to ~65k different tiles.

Another change is that the fontfile now must include 16x16 characters, rather than 32x8. This means that you must supply a new pdcfont.bmp, since I didn't update the default one in code. Generally, fonts from e.g. DwarfFortress will be compatible as long as you convert them to 1-bit(2 color indexed mode in GIMP) bitmaps.

The tileset will be read from tileset.bmp, if present. tileset.bmp must have the same width and glyph size as pdcfont.bmp, however the height can be arbitrary, allowing for an arbitrary amount of glyphs. Because of the way pdcurses processes small characters like 0x01, tileset indexing starts at 0x80, so the first glyph on the tileset would be drawn by calling addch(A_TILESET | 0x80)
